ROLE

You are a world-class healthcare product designer, brand strategist, UX architect, and conversion copywriter who has built premium websites for Apple Health, WHO-backed startups, and modern AI health platforms.

Design a highly distinctive, premium, trust-first marketing website for a preventive healthcare app called VytalCare.
This must stand apart visually, emotionally, and intellectually from generic health apps.

PRODUCT CONTEXT

App: VytalCare
Category: Preventive Healthcare + Agentic AI
Philosophy: Healthcare should act before illness appears — not after damage is done.

Core Capabilities:

Tracks vitals (steps, sleep, heart rate, hydration, BMI)

Health Score with visual rings & trends

AI detects early risk patterns (no diagnosis)

Smart medication reminders (calendar-synced)

Prescription image → structured schedules

AI health assistant (RAG, trusted sources)

Caregiver & emergency integration

Accessibility-first (dark mode, color-blind)

Privacy-first, ethical AI stance

WEBSITE GOAL

Create a marketing website that:

Makes preventive healthcare feel inevitable & empowering

Builds medical-grade trust instantly

Visually conveys “this app thinks ahead for you”

Converts users to join waitlist / download app

TONE & BRAND

Calm, confident, intelligent

Apple Health × WHO × Modern AI lab

Simple, not dumbed down

Avoid: hype words, fear, fitness-influencer tone
Prefer: quiet confidence, clarity, visual storytelling

VISUAL & UI DIRECTION

Clean, futuristic healthcare aesthetic

Soft gradients, glow accents, depth

Data-driven visuals (rings, graphs, flows)

Generous white space

Palette: white base, deep slate/navy, teal/emerald highlights
UI Elements: health rings, animated graphs, cards, floating AI insights, soft micro-interactions
